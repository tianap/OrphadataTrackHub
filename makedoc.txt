This track hub includes aggregated publicly available data from Orphadata - an online resource for disorders and associated genes (as well as phenotypes and epidemiological data) from Orphanet. 

The bigBed file is created using the shell script updateOrphanet.sh which can be found in /cluster/home/tmpereir/public_html/trackHubs/orphadata (change to permanent location). The script downloads all relevant .xml files from Orphadata, calls a Python python script, parseOrphadata.py, that scrapes the files and captures all information necessary for the track (more information on the Orphadata files can be found in the docstrings for parseOrphadata.py).

FILE DOWNLOAD

The following files were downloaded from Orphadata (http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/index.php):

File: GENES ASSOCIATED WITH RARE DISEASES
Download: http://www.orphadata.org/data/xml/en_product6.xml

File: PHENOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH RARE DISORDERS
Download: http://www.orphadata.org/data/xml/en_product4.xml

File: RARE DISEASES EPIDEMIOLOGY

File: RARE DISEASES NATURAL HISTORY

Gene information was used through the file http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/genes/hg19.ensGene.gtf.gz  and is read by parseOrphadata.py.

All information from these files is included in one track. 

PARSING THROUGH DOWNLOADED FILES

All of the above files were parsed using a Python script, parseOrphadata.py that is included here: /cluster/home/tmpereir/public_html/trackHubs/orphadata. More information regarding how the script works is included in the Python script itself.

CREATING BED

The BED file contains a total of 25 fields:

        1. chrom : name of chromosome in which gene exists (required)
        2. chromStart : start position of gene (required)
        3. chromEnd : end position of gene (required)
        4. name : name of the BED line; the OrphaCode for each disorder is used here
        5. score : score between 0 and 1000; not relevant to this track and is by default 0
        6. strand : defines the strand, either "+", "-", or "." for no strand
        7. thickStart : start position where gene is drawn thickly (same as field 2)
        8. thickEnd : end position where gene is drawn thickly (same as field 3)
        9. itemRgb : color of the item
        10. disorderName : name of the disorder
        11. geneSymbol : HGNC-approved gene symbol
        12. geneName : gene name
        13. ensemblID : identifier used within Ensembl database
        14. geneType : the type of gene
        15. geneLocus : gene chromosomal location
        16. assnStatus : whether disorder-gene association is validated or not
        17. assnType : type of gene-disease relationship
        18. pmid : PMID reference(s)
        19. orphaCode : unique numerical identifier internal to Orphanet
        20. omim : OMIM reference
        21. hgnc : HGNC reference
        22. inheritance : type(s) of inheritance associated with the disorder
        23. onsetList : list of ages of onset associated with the disorder
        24. deathList : list of average ages of death associated with the disorder
        25. prevalences : types of prevalence associated with disorder

Each item in the BED file is a disorder that is associated with a gene, whose chromosomal coordinates are included in the track line. For example: 

       <GeneA chr>   <GeneA start>  <GeneA end> <Disorder1 ID> ... <Disorder1 Name> ... <disorder info>
        <GeneB chr>   <GeneB start>  <GeneB end> <Disorder1 ID> ... <Disorder1 Name> ... <disorder info>
        <GeneC chr>   <GeneC start>  <GeneC end> <Disorder1 ID> ... <Disorder1 Name> ... <disorder info>

CONVERTING BED TO BIGBED

The following commands were used to convert the BED file to bigBed format (these commands can be found in updateOrphanet.sh).
The variable $date includes the timestamp at which the script is called, and $parentPath includes the parent directory for the Orphadata track.
NOTE: the hg38 bigBed file is created by the same commands but replacing 'hg19' to 'hg38'

# sort the BED file
> sort -k1,1 -k2,2n "$orphadata.hg19.date.bed" > sortedOrphadata.hg19.bed

# Get hg19 chromsizes
> fetchChromSizes hg19 > hg19.chrom.sizes

# bigBed file name
> bedToBigBed -tab -as="$parentPath/orphadata.as" -type=bed9+ sortedOrphadata.hg19.bed "$parentPath/hg19.chrom.sizes" "orphadata.hg19.$date.bb"

NOTE: -tab needs to be used, otherwise errors relating to fields will occur

The final hg19 and hg38 bigBed files are then copied over to the hg19 and hg38 directories, respectively. 

UPDATING TRACKDB FILE

The trackDb.txt file must then be manually updated with the new bigBed file names.
